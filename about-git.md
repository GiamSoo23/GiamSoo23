# About Git

If you don't know much about computers or programming, you may not know git either. Today I'm going to explain (at least what I've learned or remebered) about it.

## What is git?

Git it's a type of document that is used to have a well organized programming. With it you can work with a team together using the cloud at the same time, using webpages as github.

### How could I work with?

1. Have an account on the cloud to your liking: I recommend you github.
2. You must open Visual Studio on your computer: you should downloaded it already.
3. You must open the terminal and write the first command: `git init` to create a repository.
4. Now you are allowed to create your first commit! But first you should create any type of document and make any change.
5. After that, you should save the document and with the command `git commit`you will sync your work to the cloud.

With these few steps you will be able to start programming!

You are excited, don't you? See you in the next tutorial :D
